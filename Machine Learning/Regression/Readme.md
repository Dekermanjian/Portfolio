# Regression

In this section we have two projects.

In one project we build a recommender engine using Alternating Least Squares. This recommender will recommend movies to users based on their and similar other user's ratings.

In the other project we build a time series weather forceast model using TensorFlow. We predict minimum daily temperatures by using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers.
