# Welcome to the Statistical Inference section of my portfolio

In this section I share projects related to:
## Survival Analysis
We explore the time to having a stroke using the famous Framingham data. We apply the standard Cox Proportional Hazards model and the extended Cox model that accounts for time-dependent covariates.

## Spatial Temporal Modeling
Here we explore global temperature increases in relation to carbon dioxide emissions and total atmospheric carbon dioxide. We use a deterministic Bayesian framework to model the fixed and random effects.
